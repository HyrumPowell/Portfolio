# Animatronic Helmet Control System  
### Dreamwalk – Tin Man Headpiece

## Project Overview
I designed and built a wearable **animatronic helmet** for Dreamwalk as part of a short film promotion. The goal was to create a reliable, lightweight electromechanical system capable of coordinated motion and lighting effects while being safely worn and operated by an actor.

The project required integrating mechanical design, embedded control, wiring, and real-time troubleshooting within tight physical and usability constraints.

## System Description
The animatronic system was housed inside a helmet styled as a Tin Man character. The system controlled multiple mechanical movements and lighting effects while remaining compact, lightweight, and comfortable for the performer.

Key system requirements included:
- Coordinated motion across multiple actuators
- Safe operation near the user’s head
- Reliable real-time control
- Remote operation capability
- Modular mechanical design for maintenance and adjustments

## Hardware Components
- Arduino Nano microcontroller
- 10 hobby servo motors 
- Servo control board
- LEDs for lighting effects
- RC receiver and transmitter
- Custom 3D printed mechanical components
- Power distribution and wiring harnesses

## Control & Software
- Programmed embedded control logic in **C** on Arduino
- Coordinated multiple servo outputs for expressive motion
- Integrated RC input for remote triggering and control
- Implemented timing and sequencing logic for smooth actuation
- Tuned motion limits to prevent mechanical binding and ensure user safety

## Mechanical Design
- Designed custom mechanisms in CAD to fit within the helmet geometry
- 3D printed components for rapid iteration and weight reduction
- Balanced actuator placement to reduce strain and improve reliability
- Designed assemblies for easy disassembly and maintenance

## My Role
- Mechanical design and CAD modeling
- 3D printing and mechanical assembly
- Electrical wiring and system integration
- Embedded programming and motion sequencing
- Debugging mechanical, electrical, and software issues
- System testing and refinement prior to filming

## Challenges & Solutions
**Space constraints:**  
The limited interior volume required compact mechanisms and careful wire routing. Multiple design iterations were used to optimize layout and serviceability.

**Motion coordination:**  
Early tests showed unsynchronized servo movement. Control logic was refined to improve timing and smooth transitions.

**Reliability during wear:**  
Because the system was worn by an actor, reliability and safety were critical. Motion limits and mechanical stops were implemented to reduce risk and fatigue.

## Results
- Delivered a fully functional wearable animatronic helmet
- Successfully used in a filmed promotional production
- Demonstrated reliable operation during extended wear
- Achieved coordinated motion and lighting effects

## What I Learned
- Designing electromechanical systems under human-safety constraints
- Coordinating multiple actuators using embedded control logic
- Rapid iteration using CAD and additive manufacturing
- System-level debugging across mechanical, electrical, and software domains
