# Hyrum Powell — Engineering Portfolio

Welcome to my engineering portfolio repository.

I am a **Mechatronics Engineering graduate** with hands-on experience in electromechanical systems, automation-adjacent manufacturing, embedded control, and system-level troubleshooting. This repository hosts my **GitHub Pages portfolio**, where I document engineering projects, technical skills, and ongoing learning in controls and automation.

## About Me

I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in **Mechatronics Engineering** from Utah Valley University (Magna Cum Laude, GPA 3.8). My background combines:

- Mechanical design and fabrication  
- Electrical wiring and system integration  
- Embedded control systems  
- Manufacturing and CNC automation environments  

I am currently:
- Building hands-on **controls and PLC skills**
- Documenting real engineering projects
- Preparing for roles in **Automation, Controls, or Mechatronics Engineering**

## Why This Portfolio Exists

This portfolio is intentionally:
- **Honest** — reflects real experience, not inflated claims  
- **Hands-on** — focused on real systems, not just theory  
- **Evolving** — updated as I continue building controls and automation projects  

It serves as a practical supplement to my resume for engineering roles.
