# Mechatronics Engineering Capstone  
### Automated Vertical Prize Carousel Machine

## Project Overview
As part of my Mechatronics Engineering capstone, I worked on a multidisciplinary team to design and build a fully functional automated vertical prize display carousel for a commercial entertainment application.

The project required integrating mechanical design, electrical wiring, control logic, fabrication, and system-level troubleshooting to deliver a working machine within a fixed timeline.

## System Description
The machine consisted of a rotating vertical carousel used to display and dispense prizes. The system required precise mechanical alignment, reliable motion control, and safe electrical operation.

Key subsystems included:
- Mechanical frame and rotating carousel
- Motor-driven motion system
- Sensors and electrical inputs
- Control logic for sequencing and safety
- Electrical wiring and power distribution

## My Contributions
- Participated in mechanical design and fabrication of custom components
- Machined and assembled mechanical parts
- Wired motors, sensors, and electrical components
- Assisted with developing and testing control logic and sequencing
- Troubleshot mechanical, electrical, and integration issues during system testing

## Challenges & Solutions
**Mechanical alignment:**  
Initial alignment issues caused binding during rotation. We adjusted tolerances and redesigned mounting features to improve reliability.

**Control sequencing:**  
Early control logic caused timing issues between motion and sensor feedback. We refined the sequence logic and validated behavior through repeated testing.

**System integration:**  
Combining mechanical, electrical, and control subsystems required iterative debugging and cross-team coordination.

## What I Learned
- System-level troubleshooting of electromechanical systems
- Designing mechanisms for manufacturability and assembly
- Translating design intent into functional hardware
- Working effectively within a multidisciplinary engineering team
